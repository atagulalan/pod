# POD Project

Basic principle of our work is so that children grasp algorithms with games. Learning is the basis of our project. The learning theories we need in order to get the children to learn the algorithm after primary school, which is the target group, has been researched. Along with the researched techniques, the project has been developed in a way that will contribute positively to the children to understand the concepts of
algorithm.
POD is an application that supports multiple platforms. Although it is a web application, it can work like a mobile application on mobile devices with the PWA technology it contains.
